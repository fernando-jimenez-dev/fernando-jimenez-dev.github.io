		<p>
			I'm a Systems Engineer by education and a Software Engineer by craft. I
			didn't start with programming. I started with the whole machine - racks,
			servers, networking, operating systems. I liked computers because they
			felt mysterious. They still kind of do.
		</p>
		<p>Then I saw the code behind them.</p>
		<p>
			The moment I understood that the "magic" wasn't magic at all - it was just
			logic written by someone - something shifted. Every system I admired was
			built by a person sitting at a keyboard, thinking clearly. That meant I
			could do it too.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first time I wrote something that worked - really worked - and saw
			someone react to it like it was magic, that feeling stayed with me.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I was still in college, I had access to Microsoft Dev Essentials
			benefits, which included Pluralsight. One of my professors had mentioned
			Angular as something worth looking into. It wasn't part of our curriculum.
			I had no idea what it really was. I just chose a course - Angular 2 by
			Deborah Kurata - and started learning.
		</p>
		<p>
			That experience was different from classroom learning. I had to pause,
			rewind, take notes, try things on my own, break them, and try again. It
			wasn't about getting a grade. It was about understanding. That's where I
			began figuring out how I learn best - through repetition, experimentation,
			and building small things until the ideas click.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I later started working in 2017 at a small software shop in Tacna,
			Peru, that self-taught foundation mattered. We were building ERP systems in
			a small team, and I began applying what I had learned, gradually
			introducing more modern web approaches where it made sense. Not as a
			revolution, just as evolution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Small teams meant real responsibility. I moved from intern to junior
			quickly because there wasn't much separation between learning and doing. If
			something needed to be built, you built it. I learned what trust inside a
			team looks like. I learned how important mentorship is - both receiving it
			and giving it.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2019, I moved to Lima to join Avantica (now Encora) and began working
			with Guggenheim as a client. The scale changed completely. Larger teams.
			Enterprise expectations. Offshore dynamics. More structure, more
			coordination, more visibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had to grow quickly - not just as a programmer, but as someone who could
			explain decisions clearly, ask better questions, and represent ideas well.
		</p>
		<p>
			Somewhere in those years, I started feeling a different kind of friction:
			structure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every time I began a new project, I felt the same uncertainty. Why is this
			organized this way? Why does every solution look different? MVC was my
			default because that's what I knew, but I couldn't explain why it was the
			right answer.
		</p>
		<p>
			That frustration pushed me deeper into reading. Clean Architecture was the
			first thing that truly made sense to me. Use Cases. Clear boundaries. The
			idea that a system's structure should reflect what it actually does. It
			wasn't about copying a diagram. It was about finally having language for
			something I had been wrestling with internally.
		</p>
		<p>
			From there, I kept exploring - SOLID principles, design patterns, The Art
			of Unit Testing, TDD, later Vertical Slice and DDD. Some ideas resonated
			deeply. Some felt too rigid in practice. I wasn't trying to adopt
			everything. I was trying to understand what holds up under real use.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over time, I realized I think best in abstractions first. I look for the
			core unit of behavior. I ask what belongs together and what doesn't. Then I
			test those ideas in real code. If the structure survives change, it's
			probably sound. If it creates friction, I rethink it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clean Cut Architecture emerged from that process. It's my ongoing synthesis
			of Clean Architecture and Vertical Slice lessons - centered on use cases,
			cohesion, and making intent visible. It isn't fixed. It evolves as I
			evolve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Delivery and automation entered my thinking more organically. In my early
			years, deployments were mostly manual. Later, during my consulting time, I
			was exposed to fully scripted build and release pipelines for the first
			time. Seeing everything automated end-to-end raised a new question for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we care this much about how code is structured, shouldn't we care just
			as much about how it's built and delivered?
		</p>
		<p>
			I didn't decide to "move into DevOps." I started reading pipeline scripts
			because something broke and needed fixing. I learned by tracing failures,
			understanding versioning, and asking why the system was designed that way.
			Responsibility naturally expanded beyond just writing code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually, I moved to the United States and transitioned into a full-time
			role with Guggenheim. That shift brought a different level of ownership. I
			was no longer consulting from the outside. I was part of the in-house team,
			helping shape decisions more directly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Architecture became broader. It wasn't only about folder structure anymore.
			It was about how decisions affect teams, environments, release cycles, and
			long-term sustainability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Today, I build backend systems primarily in C# and .NET. I still think
			abstractly to connect ideas. Then I bring those ideas down into
			implementation and let the code challenge them.
		</p>
		<p>I see software engineering as systems thinking expressed through code.</p>
		<p class="story-landing-start">
			I care about structure that ages well. Automation that reduces friction.
			Clarity that helps teams move faster &mdash; not just code that compiles.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is how I approach the craft today. I keep learning. I keep changing my
			mind. I keep trying to improve, even if it's just a bit at a time.
